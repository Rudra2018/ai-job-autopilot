# SentenceTransformer based on sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2

This is a [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) model specifically trained for job title matching and similarity. It's finetuned from [sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2) on a large dataset of job titles and their associated skills/requirements across multiple languages. The model maps English, Spanish, German and Chinese job titles and descriptions to a 1024-dimensional dense vector space and can be used for semantic job title matching, job similarity search, and related HR/recruitment tasks.

The model was presented in the paper [Multilingual JobBERT for Cross-Lingual Job Title Matching](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.21609).

## Model Details

### Model Description
- **Model Type:** Sentence Transformer
- **Base model:** [sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2) <!-- at revision 84fccfe766bcfd679e39efefe4ebf45af190ad2d -->
- **Maximum Sequence Length:** 64 tokens
- **Output Dimensionality:** 1024 dimensions
- **Similarity Function:** Cosine Similarity
- **Training Dataset:** 4 x 5.2M high-quality job title - skills pairs in English, Spanish, German and Chinese

### Model Sources

- **Documentation:** [Sentence Transformers Documentation](https://sbert.net)
- **Repository:** [Sentence Transformers on GitHub](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers)

  )
)
```

## Usage

### Direct Usage (Sentence Transformers)

First install the Sentence Transformers library:

```bash
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

Then you can load and use the model with the following code:
```python
import torch
import numpy as np
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sentence_transformers.util import batch_to_device, cos_sim

# Load the model
model = SentenceTransformer("TechWolf/JobBERT-v3")

def encode_batch(jobbert_model, texts):
    features = jobbert_model.tokenize(texts)
    features = batch_to_device(features, jobbert_model.device)
    features["text_keys"] = ["anchor"]
    with torch.no_grad():
        out_features = jobbert_model.forward(features)
    return out_features["sentence_embedding"].cpu().numpy()

def encode(jobbert_model, texts, batch_size: int = 8):
    # Sort texts by length and keep track of original indices
    sorted_indices = np.argsort([len(text) for text in texts])
    sorted_texts = [texts[i] for i in sorted_indices]
    
    embeddings = []
    
    # Encode in batches
    for i in tqdm(range(0, len(sorted_texts), batch_size)):
        batch = sorted_texts[i:i+batch_size]
        embeddings.append(encode_batch(jobbert_model, batch))
    
    # Concatenate embeddings and reorder to original indices
    sorted_embeddings = np.concatenate(embeddings)
    original_order = np.argsort(sorted_indices)
    return sorted_embeddings[original_order]

# Example usage
job_titles = [
    'Software Engineer',
    '高级软件开发人员',  # senior software developer
    'Produktmanager',  # product manager
    'Científica de datos'  # data scientist
]

# Get embeddings
embeddings = encode(model, job_titles)

# Calculate cosine similarity matrix
similarities = cos_sim(embeddings, embeddings)
print(similarities)
```

The output will be a similarity matrix where each value represents the cosine similarity between two job titles:

```
tensor([[1.0000, 0.8087, 0.4673, 0.5669],
        [0.8087, 1.0000, 0.4428, 0.4968],
        [0.4673, 0.4428, 1.0000, 0.4292],
        [0.5669, 0.4968, 0.4292, 1.0000]])
```
